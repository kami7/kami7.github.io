            <h3>46 Thoughts from my first Tortuga Music Festival</h3>
              <p>I’m not a pro when it comes to country music. I’m from California, and for the most part, we enjoy rap and alternative, but this year, I have discovered a new kind of music–country.</p>
              <p>When my friends asked if I wanted to go to Tortuga, a country music festival on the beach in Fort Lauderdale, I figured, why not? College is about experiences, so I figured I should try everything at least once–and if the whole weekend’s a bust, at least I would get to see Lynyrd Skynyrd live (one of the best moments of my life, btw).</p>
              <p>Turns out, country music concerts are awesome. I had a way better time then I had originally thought and I low-key may have a new obsession with cowboys. Here are 46 thoughts I had at my first visit to Tortuga Music Festival.</p>
              <p>1.“This place is massive, three full sized stages, at least 20 different places to eat including Pad Thai. This place is heaven!”</p>
              <p>2.“Wait who is playing right now? I actually know this song!”</p>
              <p>3.“I didn’t know she sang this song…</p>
              <p>4.“Aww! look at the cute couple! They’re wearing matching cowboy hats :’)”</p>
              <p>5.“Ugh, that country style lemonade looks wonderful. I need one now.”</p>
              <p>6.“100 percent worth the arm and a leg I used to pay for it.”</p>
              <p>7.“How have I already spent 20 bucks on food?”</p>
              <p>8.“Wait–how do you dance to country music?”</p>
              <p>9.“I don’t look country enough… I need a cowboy hat.”</p>
              <p>10.A”re those raindrops? Dang, the sky just got really dark. Wait, we have to evacuate?!” (Yes the whole festival got evacuated)</p>
              <p>11.“I am not leaving. I need to see Old Dominion!”</p>
              <p>12.“Okay police officer I will leave now.” (Awkwardly smiles and power walks away).</p>
              <p>13.“Its actually raining now. We need to find shelter.”</p>
              <p>14.“Sure. Why not hide from the rain in a random person’s garage with 30 other Tortuga goers?”</p>
              <p>15.“We have been sitting here for 2 hours waiting for updates and I’m hungry.”</p>
              <p>16.“Finally, pizza!” ~Ten minutes later Tortuga tweets that the gates are opening again and Dierks Bentley will start playing in 30 minutes.~</p>
              <p>17. Grabs two slices of pizza and starts sprinting with friends to the gates while eating said pizza.</p>
              <p>18.“I might throw up–too much running and too much pizza.”</p>
              <p>19.“But it will be worth it! Think of the cute cowboy on stage! Keep runnning!”</p>
              <p>20.“Okay, we are through the gates. Now, time to climb and claw my way to the front of the crowd. I need to be up front and center.”</p>
              <p>21.“Wait why do I have to be up front? Do I even know any of Dierks Bentley’s songs?”</p>
              <p>22.“OMG I know this song! I love this song!”</p>
              <p>23.“I need to remember this song for later.”</p>
              <p>24.“Whelp that was awesome. Time to go home.”</p>
              <p>25.“How long has it been since we called the Uber?”</p>
              <p>26.“Why does it feel like we have been waiting for this Uber for forever?”</p>
              <p>27.“Who knew traffic could actually get worse. Why are there so many one-way streets in Fort Lauderdale?”</p>
              <p>28.“Day two lets gooooo!”</p>
              <p>29.“Lynyrd Skynyrd is killing it– I have goose bumps!”</p>
              <p>30.“This is maybe the best performance I have ever seen.”</p>
              <p>31.O”kay time to run to see Sam Hunt.”</p>
              <p>32.“Why does it seem like we are always running?”</p>
              <p>33.“Lets run again, time to see Tim McGraw!”</p>
              <p>34.“Why are these stages so far apart?!?”</p>
              <p>35.“I don’t know any of these songs, I need to listen to more music.”</p>
              <p>36.“This is super country, and I kinda love it…I am a changed woman.”</p>
              <p>37.“Okay last day, time to see the love of my life Thomas Rhett.”</p>
              <p>38.“Ugh! He is so beautiful why am I not married to him?”</p>
              <p>39.“He literally has the best songs. I love this song! And that one–and that one too.”</p>
              <p>40.“Now back to the other stage!! Onward!!”</p>
              <p>41.“Billy Currington is fabulous. I love him, even though I had no idea who he was until five minutes ago but he’s fab.”</p>
              <p>42.“Mental note, I need to Spotify him when I get back.”</p>
              <p>43.“The moment I have been waiting for. Blake Shelton..Yes!”</p>
              <p>44.I might die if he plays Sangria.”</p>
              <p>45. Blake: **Plays Sangria** Me: **faints**</p>
              <p>46.“Okay. Done. When do next year’s tickets go on sale?”</p>
              <p>Overall, Tortuga was one of the best weekends of my life. Even if you are not a country fanatic, Tortuga is awesome. Its great to go to the beach and listen to live music with your friends. Ten out of Ten would recommend.</p>

          <h3>Singing for a good cause and a good time</h3>
            <section class="flow">
              <p>It’s hard to be original when it comes to Valentine’s Day. It’s a holiday that’s been around for years and every year it seems to get harder and harder to be original with your V-day gifts. Luckily Phi Mu Alpha has you covered. It’s that special time of the year when lucky guys and gals get serenaded in the middle of their crowded lecture halls. There is nothing better then seeing the faces of pure surprise of those who receive these singing valentines.</p>
              <p>Phi Mu Alpha is a UM social fraternity that belongs to the Frost School of Music and is well known for its performing capabilities. Every year they sell and preform singing valentines. They set up a booth in the breezeway a week or so before they begin the singing valentines and people can  purchase a $5 serenade for their special someone. Today at 8 am marked the official start of the singing valentines. “The singing valentines have been a tradition within our fraternity for a long time,” commented Vice President Jake Pressman.  “When you purchase a singing valentine, we ask for the name of the person, the classroom and the time. We literally will go to that class and tell the professor that we are here to do a singing valentine and we ask politely if it is okay if we sing to them. It’s just a really fun way to make people happy during Valentine’s week and, also, it is the biggest fundraiser our chapter has.”</p>
              <p>“Our entire mission is to spread the power of music across America,” said Pressman. “We try to do philanthropy toward that mission statement, we go to people in not so great circumstances like at the Ronald McDonald House and local hospitals and we sing to them with either standard repertoire music or any solo acts we have.” The Mills Music Mission, named after Phi Alpha Mu’s founder Ossian E. Mills, is one of the fraternity’s main philanthropies. As part of the Mills Music Mission, members of the fraternity sing for those in less fortunate situations. The fraternity has also been involved with Feeding South Florida, a food drive dedicated to those in need in South Florida.</p>
              <p>Due to the fact that Phi Alpha Mu is part of the Frost School of Music, many of its recruits come from the music school. But many of its members are not music students.“We have a recruitment process that starts three weeks into every semester,” said Pressman. “The Frost School of Music’s Band of the Hour is our usual recruitment pool, but you don’t have to be a music major to be in the fraternity. You don’t even need to play an instrument; you just need to have a love for music.”</p>

            <h3>Yuga is hidden gem not to be overlooked</h3>
              <section class="flow">
              <p>Miracle Mile is an area frequented by University of Miami college students and all those local to Coral Gables. Some of the most popular areas to go to are Poc, a sushi buffet style restaurant, and Yard House, whose all-American menu makes it a college student favorite.</p>
              <p>Time and time again we see how locals and students continue to visit these local favorites and some restaurants are simply overlooked, Yuga is the perfect example of this. Nestled on a quiet block of Alcazar Avenue three blocks from the Coral Gables Museum, Yuga is just the place for those who are fans of Asian fusion cuisine. A perfect mix of Thai, Filipino and Japanese cuisine, Yuga brings a refreshing take on Asian Cuisine that is unlike anything you have experienced.</p>
              <p>When first approaching the restaurant, it is hard to find due to the quiet nature of the street. The restaurant is usually the only building on the block that has its lights on at night. When driving up, many will second guess whether they are on the right street but Yuga’s big front windows and sign up front are sure to catch your attention.</p>
              <p>Once you walk in, you are greeted by a friendly hostess that immediately takes you to your table. For some unknown reason, the multiple times I have been to the restaurant for dinner, Yuga has an abundance of open tables. The wait staff is very friendly and always makes sure you have clean plates and utensils and are always quick to refill your drink. The waiters are also very quick to take your order and bring your food as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p>Yuga’s menu is not very long but at the same time offers many options. Some of the best dishes on the menu can be found on the first page under appetizers. It’s famous “Tuna Sandwiches” are to die for and should be definitely something you order. Cooked tuna wrapped in seaweed and rice then fried, the tuna sandwiches are a perfect dish to share among friends for $7.25.</p>
              <p>Another great dish under their list of appetizers is their Wild Mushroom salad, for $9.25. Unlike anything anyone has seen before, the salad is piled high with different types of mushrooms and topped with a sauce that will make you want to like the plate clean. When it comes to entrees, Yuga has it all. No matter what kind of picky eaters with whom you may be dining. Yuga’s extensive entrée options will have something for everyone. From curry to noodles to ramen to sushi, Yuga will not disappoint. It even has a section on the sushi menu called “nothing raw” for those that enjoy sushi but are not up for eating raw fish. Their extensive sushi menu, ranging from $3.50-$12, includes everything from the classic California roll to rolls under their “funky” column that include rolls with conch fritters inside and something they call fried dynamite.</p>
              <p>For those who enjoy dining with good drink to go along with good food, Yuga once again has you covered. Along with their many dishes, Yuga has a long list of cold and hot sake, from which diners can choose. But one of Yuga’s staples that everyone should end a meal with is the Thai Donuts at $5.</p>
              <p>Lightly fried pieces of dough sprinkled with powdered sugar, these donuts take the prize for best dessert. Simple but amazing are the only way to describe them. Served warm and freshly fried, the Thai Donuts are a must have. These small melt in your mouth morsels are plated along side three different dipping sauces that patrons can try. The chocolate and strawberry sauces are good but the condensed milk sauce is by far the best. The cool temperature of the condensed milk sauce paired with the warm donuts, creates a flavor in your mouth, which will leave you wanting more. So don’t be surprised if you end up ordering two orders instead of one.</p>
              <p>There is not much for which to criticize Yuga other than its strange hours. This may be Yuga’s only downfall and maybe the reason why Yuga goes along without much fanfare. Most restaurants are open from 11 a.m. to 11p.m., for the most part. But unlike most restaurants Yuga is open for lunch from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and open for dinner from 6 p.m.-10:30 p.m., Monday through Saturday. These unusual hours have left me at times stranded in front of the restaurant, waiting for them to open at 6 p.m. Be careful if you are someone who enjoys having dinner early.</p>
              <p>Other than hours, Yuga should be considered on of Coral Gables best and should be on your list of restaurant to try. It is a great place to bring your family due to its casual ambiance and is sure to have something for everyone. Overall, Yuga is a hidden gem that many overlook.</p>

            <h3>Garratt successful with debut ‘Phase’</h3>
              <section class="flow">
                <p>“Phase,” Jack Garratt’s debut album, is a true success in the making and the beginning of a very successful future.Garratt, a 24-year-old British singer and songwriter, released his first album “Phase” on Feb. 19 and is slowly gaining ground. It is featured on the new releases chart on iTunes next to famous names like G Easy, Sia and Wiz Khalifa.</p>
                <p>What sets “Phase” apart from other indie rock is its sound. Mixing piano and electronica beats; Garratt has created calming music with a mesmerizing beat. One would think this seems like an easy thing, but when putting thought into it, one realizes that it is odd to find music that is relaxing but at the same time interesting and motivating to listen to. Garratt, who is from a small English town called Little Chalfont, began writing music at age 12. The singer and songwriter can be categorized as an electro-pop artist, who is known for his use of electric guitar, drum machines and the keyboards.</p>
                <p>The beginning of Garratt’s career was in 2005 when he competed in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, but in 2014 Garratt’s music took off. That year he released “Worry” and “The Love You’re Given,” and soon after in 2016 released his new debut album “Phase.” Garratt has preformed in various festivals, and has supported artists on tour like Mumford and Sons, during their 2015 UK tour.Garratt’s new album “Phase” is a combination of slow and a fast song that all have the Garratt sound and style and perfectly exhibits his versatility as a musician and singer.Not only do the mixing of music styles set Garratt apart, but also his voice is like no other. His voice is a mix of raspy rock and roll mixed with pop is the best way to explain it. His voice is iconic and can be compared to iconic voices like Adele and Justin Timberlake, which can be recognized easily.</p>
                <p>“Phase” is a deluxe album that comes with two CDS with 12 songs on one CD and seven on the second.The album features one song with three parts that are each individual tracks. The first part of “Synesthesia” does not feature any singing and is just different mixes of multiple instruments and electronic beats.</p>
                <p>Part II follows the same beat and style but introduces deep lyrics about the coalescence of two minds, “But first I’ll open up your mind and coalesce with mine,” wrote Garratt. Part II steals the show and leaves all the other songs on the album in the dust. A perfect mix of lyrics and beats the song is great and really shows off Garratt’s style. He is great at finding the right timing for each lyric and beat drop.Part III is similar to Part II but, at the same time, distinct in the fact that it introduces more electronic beats, and has a beat in the background that reminds one of a heartbeat. The song repeats the lyrics “I hope you know that if I have to go, it’s only if you want me to. I hope the sounds you see could help you paint a picture of me and you.” The second and third part of “Synesthesia” tells a story of falling in love and the union of two minds and then the separation of those minds.</p>
                <p>Part III really expresses the pain of separating from someone you love and the physical reactions to that separation. The music has a very fast and strong pace that fluctuates many times and resembles that of a faltering heart beat that is racing. Through lyrics and beats, Garratt relates to all of us because we all know what it feels like to loose something that was once our entire world.</p>
                <p>The album also features two versions of the song “Water,” an acoustic version and a non-acoustic version. It is hard to decide which version is better. The lyrics of the both tracks are what really make the love song. Water is the metaphor Garratt uses to talk about the feeling of losing control that occurs when you fall in love. Garratt sings about how one can be washed over by love but reminds us, “Its short-lived, boys.”</p>
                <p>The acoustic version is done on piano, as he sings you feel goose bumps, as each note that he hits is full of emotion and feelings, something that is very rare in today’s music world. Overall, “Phase” is a great debut album that is sure to have success. Garratt has been awarded Introducing Artist of the Year and Sound of 2016 by the BBC and a Critics Choice award by the BRIT Awards, and this is just the beginning. Garratt’s talent is incredible and it would not be surprising if his list of awards got bigger by the end of the year.</p>
